# Tanzania-Local-Food-Market-Finder
An open-source web app that helps people find local Tanzanian food markets, what they sell, and when they’re open. Why this project matters Many markets in Tanzania (like Kariakoo, Mwenge, Buguruni) don’t have good digital visibility. Tourists, new residents struggle to know where to find fresh produce, fish, or unique Tanzanian specialties.
